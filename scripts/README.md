# Scripts

Developer tooling and build scripts for aathoos.

## What Goes Here

- `setup.sh` — bootstrap a local development environment
- `release.sh` — tag and prepare a release
- `lint.sh` — run all linters across all components
- Platform-specific build helpers

All scripts assume they are run from the repo root. See the `Makefile` at root for common entry points.

## Status

No scripts yet. These will be added as the development toolchain is established.
