# Tests

Cross-component integration and end-to-end tests for aathoos.

## What Goes Here

- Integration tests that span multiple components (e.g., does a state change in `core/` correctly reflect in the macOS UI?)
- End-to-end tests that validate full application behavior
- Cross-platform compatibility tests

## What Doesn't Go Here

Unit tests live alongside the code they test in each component directory (`core/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/`).

## Status

No tests yet. Testing infrastructure will be established alongside the first application code.
