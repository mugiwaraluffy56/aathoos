# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds ADRs — records of significant technical decisions made during the development of aathoos.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures a decision that has a significant effect on the project: choice of programming language, UI toolkit, storage engine, build system, etc.

## Format

Each ADR is a markdown file named `NNN-short-title.md`:

```
# ADR-001: Choose Rust for core logic

## Context

## Decision

## Consequences

```
