# aathoos

> A personal management OS built for students, by students.

**aathoos** is an open-source student operating system — a unified space to manage your academics, tasks, goals, notes, and life. No more juggling five different apps. Just one place that works the way your brain does.

---

## What is aathoos?

Students deal with a unique kind of chaos — assignments, exams, projects, side hustles, and trying to have a life. aathoos is built to tame that chaos. Think of it as your second brain: organized, fast, and actually useful.

This is an early-stage open-source project. We're just getting started, and we'd love for you to be part of it.
