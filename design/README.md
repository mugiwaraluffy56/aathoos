# Design

UI/UX design files and specifications for aathoos.

## What Goes Here

- Wireframes and mockups
- Design system documentation (spacing, colors, typography, components)
- User flow diagrams
- Exported specs from design tools

## Design Tool

Primary design tool: Figma (link to Figma file will be added when available).

This directory houses exported specs and assets for reference — the source of truth for UI decisions before they become code.

## Contributing

Design contributions are welcome. If you want to propose UI changes, add mockups or wireframes here and open a PR. We value design-driven development.
